## Setup

1. Download the mod from the Releases section in the sidebar, then put it in your server's `mods` folder.
2. Create `server/config/discordlink.txt` and insert into it the discord link, like so: `https://discord.gg/minecraft`
3. There is no third step

(this mod does require the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api), but you probably have that already)
